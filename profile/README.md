# 🌌 Dimension Studio

Welcome to **Dimension Studio** – a small but dangerously curious team of developers who craft weird, wild, and sometimes useful things in **Minecraft** and other digital universes. We experiment. We break stuff. Then we make it cooler.

## 💡 Who Are We?

We're just 3–4 slightly sleep-deprived devs who:

- 💻 Build cursed and blessed Minecraft plugins & mods  
- 🧪 Cook up random experiments in Java, JavaScript, Python, and whatever language we tripped over that week  
- 🛠️ Hack together utilities, bots, and tools you didn’t know you needed  
- 🎮 Breathe games, bleed code, and occasionally forget to document our commits  

We don’t follow trends. We follow bugs until they cry for mercy.

## 🚀 Projects We're Breaking (or Building)

- 🧩 **Minecraft Mods & Plugins** – Fabric, Forge, or whatever's trending this month  
- 🤖 **Game Tools & Utilities** – little tools that make a big mess (or fix one)  
- 🛸 **Experimental Projects** – because normal is boring  
- 🧠 **Side Quests** – Discord bots, web apps, or cursed scripts that shouldn't exist

## 🧠 Tech Stack of Doom

Stuff we claim to know how to use:

- ☕ Java – our weapon of choice for Minecraft modding
- 🕸️ JavaScript/Node.js – perfect for bots and bad ideas
- 🧠 Python – for scripts, quick hacks, and feeling smart
- 🧪 Other stuff – depends on our mood and caffeine level

## 🌐 Got Feedback or Wanna Scream at Us?

We live in the void of Discord: [Join us](https://discord.dimension-studio.net)  
Whether it’s bugs, love letters, or unhinged feature requests – we want it all.
